# Using Skills

## The Rule

**Invoke relevant skills BEFORE any response or action.** Even a 1% chance a skill might apply means invoke it.

If an invoked skill turns out to be wrong for the situation, you don't need to follow it. But you must check.

## Quick Reference — Skill Index

**Discipline:** test-driven-development, systematic-debugging, verification-before-completion, observe-before-editing, destructive-command-safety

**Workflow:** brainstorming, writing-plans, executing-plans, requesting-code-review, receiving-code-review, finishing-work

**Orchestration:** dispatching-parallel-agents, workflow-routing, premortem, completion-check, explore

**Tools:** beads, tmux, github, session-logs

**Continuity:** create-handoff, resume-handoff, documenting-solutions, refactor, using-git-worktrees, writing-skills

## Priority

1. **Process skills first** (brainstorming, debugging) — determine HOW to approach
2. **Implementation skills second** — guide execution

## Skill Types

**Rigid** (TDD, debugging, verification): Follow exactly. Don't adapt away discipline.

**Flexible** (patterns, exploration): Adapt principles to context.

## Red Flags

| Thought | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "This is just a simple question" | Questions are tasks. Check for skills. |
| "I need more context first" | Skill check comes BEFORE clarifying questions. |
| "Let me explore first" | Skills tell you HOW to explore. Check first. |
| "This doesn't need a formal skill" | If a skill exists, use it. |
| "I remember this skill" | Skills evolve. Read current version. |
| "The skill is overkill" | Simple things become complex. Use it. |
