Add a step-by-step log that prints each phase\nas it completes, with an animated spinner during long waits.\n\n## Target output\n\n```\n✓ Preflight checks passed\n✓ Daemon started (PID 1234)\n✓ Dispatcher socket ready\n⠋ Waiting for architect...        ← spinner animates during ~30-45s wait\n✓ Architect ready (34s)\n⠋ Waiting for manager...\n✓ Manager ready (31s)\n✓ Beacon verified\noro swarm started (PID 1234, workers=2, model=sonnet)\n```\n\n## Implementation\n\n### 1. Add a startup logger helper in cmd/oro/startup_log.go\n\nCreate a small `startupLog` struct with methods:\n- `Step(msg string)` — prints `✓ \u003cmsg\u003e` with green checkmark\n- `StepTimed(msg string, d time.Duration)` — prints `✓ \u003cmsg\u003e (Xs)` \n- `StartSpinner(msg string) func()` — starts goroutine printing braille spinner\n  `⠋⠙⠹⠸⠼⠴⠦⠧⠇⠏` at ~80ms interval on same line via `\\r`. Returns a stop func\n  that kills spinner and prints the final `✓` line.\n- Non-TTY fallback: check `isatty.IsTerminal(os.Stdout.Fd())` — if false, just\n  print static lines without spinner animation. `go-isatty` already imported.\n- Use `context.Context` for cancellation — stop func cancels spinner goroutine.\n\n### 2. Wire into cmd/oro/cmd_start.go\n\nIn `runFullStart()` (line ~98):\n\n```go\nlog := newStartupLog(os.Stdout)\n```\n\nInsert calls at each phase boundary:\n- After `preflightAndCheckRunning()` returns: `log.Step(\"Preflight checks passed\")`\n- After `SpawnDaemon()` returns: `log.Step(fmt.Sprintf(\"Daemon started (PID %d)\", pid))`\n- Before socket poll loop (line 113): `stop := log.StartSpinner(\"Waiting for dispatcher socket...\")`\n- After socket ready: `stop()` then `log.Step(\"Dispatcher socket ready\")`\n- Inside `TmuxSession.Create()` — needs a callback or logger interface passed in:\n  - Before each `WaitForPrompt`: `stop := log.StartSpinner(fmt.Sprintf(\"Waiting for %s...\", role))`\n  - After prompt ready: `stop()` then `log.StepTimed(fmt.Sprintf(\"%s ready\", role), elapsed)`\n  - Before `VerifyBeaconReceived`: `stop := log.StartSpinner(\"Verifying beacon...\")`\n  - After beacon verified: `stop()` then `log.Step(\"Beacon verified\")`\n- Keep existing final line: `\"oro swarm started (PID %d, workers=%d, model=%s)\\n\"`\n\n### 3. Pass logger into TmuxSession.Create\n\n`TmuxSession.Create()` in `tmux.go:200` is where the long waits happen. Either:\n- Add a `Logger` field to `TmuxSession` struct, or\n- Add a `StartupLogger` parameter to `Create()`\n- The logger interface: `type StartupLogger interface { Step(string); StepTimed(string, time.Duration); StartSpinner(string) func() }`\n\n### Key files\n- `cmd/oro/cmd_start.go` — runFullStart() orchestrator (line ~98-147)\n- `cmd/oro/tmux.go` — TmuxSession.Create() (line ~200), WaitForPrompt, SendKeysVerified\n- `cmd/oro/startup_log.go` — NEW file for startupLog helper\n- `cmd/oro/startup_log_test.go` — NEW file for tests\n\n### Non-TTY handling\n`go-isatty` is already imported in cmd_start.go. When stdout is not a TTY:\n- Skip spinner animation entirely\n- Print static lines: \"Waiting for architect...\" then \"✓ Architect ready (34s)\"\n\n## Acceptance criteria\n1. `oro start` prints step-by-step progress including ✓ checkmarks for completed phases\n2.

Inject beacon text via `tmux send-keys`\n2. Return success immediately\n3. `oro start` prints \"swarm started\" — no validation\n\n## Desired Flow\n1. Inject beacon text via `tmux send-keys`\n2.

{"id":"oro-8sie","title":"Filter stale attempt counts from status response for closed beads","description":"## Problem\n`oro status` shows \"QG failed Nx\" alerts for beads that are already closed (e.g., oro-9hd, oro-5srh.3). The dispatcher never clears `attemptCounts` entries when beads are closed externally via `bd close`.\n\n## Root Cause\n`buildStatusJSON()` (dispatcher.go:1917-1924) copies ALL `attemptCounts` entries into the status response without filtering. `pruneStaleTracking()` (bead_tracker.go:78) only prunes entries for beads not assigned to any worker — it never cross-references the bead source to check if a bead is closed.\n\nThree scenarios create stale entries:\n1. Bead fails QG, gets escalated, then closed externally — count persists because `clearBeadTracking` only runs on internal terminal paths\n2. Bead fails QG, is between retries (no worker assigned), then closed externally — prune catches this eventually, but only on next heartbeat tick\n3. Bead is closed while still assigned to a worker — prune skips it because worker is still active\n\n## Fix\nEnhance `pruneStaleTracking()` to cross-reference the bead source. Any tracked bead that is not in `d.beads.Ready()` AND not assigned to any worker should be pruned. This covers all three scenarios on the next heartbeat tick.\n\nAlternatively (or additionally): in `buildStatusJSON()`, when copying `attemptCounts`, filter against the set of assigned beads + queued beads.

{"id":"oro-8we1","title":"Auto-close epic beads when all children are completed","description":"## Problem\n\nWhen all children of an epic bead are completed (merged), the epic remains open indefinitely. It must be manually closed. The dispatcher has no auto-close logic for parent epics.\n\n## Current State\n\n- `filterAssignable` (dispatcher.go:1441) skips epics — they are never assigned to workers\n- After merge, `d.beads.Close()` is called at dispatcher.go:809 for the individual bead\n- The `Bead` struct has an `Epic string` field (parent epic ID) available during assignment\n- `trackedWorker` struct (dispatcher.go:89) stores `beadID` but NOT the parent `Epic` field\n- The `BeadSource` interface (dispatcher.go:57-63) has `Close`, `Show`, `Ready`, `Create`, `Sync` — no method to check children status\n- Parent-child relationships live in `bd` CLI, not in dispatcher memory\n\n## Design\n\n### 1. Store Epic field during assignment\n\nAdd `epicID string` to `trackedWorker` struct (dispatcher.go:89). Set it at assignment time (dispatcher.go:1544) from `bead.Epic`. Clear it when bead is cleared.\n\n### 2. Add `AllChildrenClosed` method to BeadSource\n\n```go\n// AllChildrenClosed checks whether all children of the given epic are closed.\n// Returns true if the epic has children and all are closed, false otherwise.\nfunc (s *CLIBeadSource) AllChildrenClosed(ctx context.Context, epicID string) (bool, error)\n```\n\nImplementation: run `bd list --parent=\u003cepicID\u003e --status=open --format=json`. If the result is an empty list (no open children), return true. If there are open children, return false. If the epic has no children at all, return false (not an epic with children).\n\nAdd to `BeadSource` interface (dispatcher.go:57).\n\n### 3. Auto-close after merge\n\nAfter `d.beads.Close()` at dispatcher.go:809, add:\n\n```go\n// Auto-close parent epic if all children are completed.\nif epicID := w.epicID; epicID != \"\" {\n    d.safeGo(func() {\n        allClosed, err := d.beads.AllChildrenClosed(ctx, epicID)\n        if err == nil \u0026\u0026 allClosed {\n            _ = d.beads.Close(ctx, epicID, \"All children completed\")\n            _ = d.logEvent(ctx, \"epic_auto_closed\", \"dispatcher\", epicID, workerID, \"\")\n        }\n    })\n}\n```\n\nNote: the `w.epicID` must be read under lock or captured before the goroutine since `mergeAndComplete` runs in a goroutine already. The worker ID lookup needs care — at line 809 we have `beadID` and `workerID` as params but NOT the `trackedWorker` directly. Need to look up epic from stored state or pass it through.\n\nAlternative approach (simpler, avoids trackedWorker changes): after closing a bead, call `bd show \u003cbeadID\u003e` to get the closed bead's details including its parent epic, then check children. This avoids storing epicID in trackedWorker but costs one extra `bd show` call per merge.\n\n## Files to Modify\n- `pkg/dispatcher/dispatcher.go` — Add epicID to trackedWorker, set during assignment, auto-close logic after merge (lines 89, 809, 1544)\n- `pkg/dispatcher/beadsource.go` — Add `AllChildrenClosed` method to CLIBeadSource\n- `pkg/dispatcher/dispatcher_test.go` — Add test, update mockBeadSource\n- `pkg/dispatcher/beadsource_test.go` — Test AllChildrenClosed\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Test: pkg/dispatcher/dispatcher_test.go:TestAutoCloseEpicWhenAllChildrenCompleted | Cmd: go test -race ./pkg/dispatcher/... -run TestAutoCloseEpic | Assert: After closing the last child bead of an epic, the epic is auto-closed via BeadSource.Close with reason \"All children completed\"\n- [ ] Test: pkg/dispatcher/beadsource_test.go:TestCLIBeadSource_AllChildrenClosed | Cmd: go test -race ./pkg/dispatcher/... -run TestAllChildrenClosed | Assert: Returns true when bd list --parent=\u003cepicID\u003e --status=open returns empty list; false when open children exist\n- [ ] Epic with open children is NOT auto-closed when one child merges\n- [ ] bd CLI errors in AllChildrenClosed are logged but do not block the merge flow\n\nRead: pkg/dispatcher/dispatcher.go:mergeAndComplete,trackedWorker,filterAssignable, pkg/dispatcher/beadsource.go:CLIBeadSource,BeadSource, pkg/protocol/types.go:Bead\nEdges: bd CLI error → log warning, skip auto-close; epic already closed → bd close returns error, ignored; bead has no parent epic → epicID is empty, skip check","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"t@t.com","created_at":"2026-02-14T01:43:02.242492-05:00","created_by":"architect","updated_at":"2026-02-14T21:49:56.044908-05:00","closed_at":"2026-02-14T21:49:56.044908-05:00","close_reason":"Tests pass, gate clean.

(2) Populate Status in CLIBeadSource.Show from bd show --json output.

{"id":"oro-cm5q","title":"Fix tmux scroll: enable scrollback past Claude Code TUI","description":"## Problem\n\nUsers cannot scroll up in the oro tmux session. Mouse scroll (and possibly keyboard scroll) only scrolls Claude Code's internal conversation history, not tmux's scrollback buffer. This prevents reviewing output that has scrolled off the top of the pane.\n\n## Root Cause\n\nClaude Code is an Ink-based TUI that uses the terminal's alternate screen buffer. When a TUI app uses the alternate screen:\n- Mouse scroll events are captured by the TUI app (Claude Code scrolls its own history)\n- tmux's scrollback buffer only contains pre-TUI content (essentially empty)\n- \\`Ctrl-b [\\` (copy-mode) works but the buffer has no useful content since the alternate screen replaces it\n\n## Current State\n\n\\`cmd/oro/tmux.go\\` does NOT configure any scroll-related tmux options:\n- No \\`set -g mouse on/off\\`\n- No \\`history-limit\\`\n- No \\`alternate-screen\\` setting\n- No \\`terminal-overrides\\`\n\nThe user's \\`~/.tmux.conf\\` may or may not have mouse mode enabled.\n\n## Design Options\n\n### Option A: Disable alternate screen in oro session (Recommended)\nConfigure tmux to not use the alternate screen buffer for the oro session. This causes Claude Code's output to flow into tmux's scrollback buffer:\n\n\\`\\`\\`go\n// In TmuxSession.Create(), add:\ns.Runner.Run(\"tmux\", \"set-option\", \"-t\", s.Name, \"alternate-screen\", \"off\")\ns.Runner.Run(\"tmux\", \"set-option\", \"-t\", s.Name, \"history-limit\", \"50000\")\n\\`\\`\\`\n\nTradeoff: Screen might not clear properly when Claude Code exits/restarts. But since Claude IS the pane process, this is acceptable.\n\n### Option B: Mouse scroll enters copy-mode\nEnable mouse mode but configure it to enter copy-mode on scroll when in alternate screen:\n\n\\`\\`\\`go\ns.Runner.Run(\"tmux\", \"set-option\", \"-t\", s.Name, \"mouse\", \"on\")\n// tmux 3.x: bind mouse wheel to copy-mode when in alternate screen\ns.Runner.Run(\"tmux\", \"bind-key\", \"-T\", \"root\", \"WheelUpPane\",\n    \"if-shell\", \"-Ft=\", \"#{alternate_on}\",\n    \"send-keys -M\", \"copy-mode -e\")\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n### Option C: Terminal overrides\nDisable alternate screen at the terminal level:\n\n\\`\\`\\`go\ns.Runner.Run(\"tmux\", \"set-option\", \"-t\", s.Name, \"terminal-overrides\", \"xterm*:smcup@:rmcup@\")\n\\`\\`\\`\n\nWorker should test all options and pick the one that gives the best scroll experience without breaking Claude Code's display.\n\n## Files to Modify\n- cmd/oro/tmux.go — Add scroll configuration in TmuxSession.Create() (after line 136)\n- cmd/oro/tmux_test.go — Test scroll configuration\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Test: cmd/oro/tmux_test.go:TestScrollbackConfiguration | Cmd: go test -race ./cmd/oro/... -run TestScrollback | Assert: TmuxSession.Create sets alternate-screen or terminal-overrides or mouse scroll binding\n- [ ] Mouse scroll in tmux pane scrolls tmux scrollback buffer (not just Claude Code history)\n- [ ] Manual test: \\`oro start\\`, generate some output, scroll up with mouse wheel — content is accessible\n\nRead: cmd/oro/tmux.go:Create (lines 94-168)\nEdges: alternate-screen=off may cause display artifacts on Claude restart → acceptable since Claude IS the pane process; tmux version \u003c 3.0 may not support some options → check with tmux -V","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"bug","owner":"t@t.com","created_at":"2026-02-14T01:53:33.841337-05:00","created_by":"architect","updated_at":"2026-02-14T22:25:37.140998-05:00","closed_at":"2026-02-14T22:25:37.140998-05:00","close_reason":"Subsumed by epic oro-5zzb (Phase 2a: oro-5zzb.4)"}

The code is on main but has defects.\n\n## Bugs to Fix\n\n### 1. [Critical] Double single-quoting in buildPaneDiedHook (tmux.go:496)\n`escapeForShell()` already wraps output in single quotes, but the format string adds another layer with `'%s'`. This produces `''content''` — in shell, `''` is empty string, leaving content unquoted. The `[ORO-DISPATCH]` brackets become a glob pattern.\n\n**Fix**: Remove the outer single quotes from the format string:\n```go\n\"run-shell \\\"tmux set-buffer -b oro-pane-died %s; tmux paste-buffer -b oro-pane-died -t %s; tmux send-keys -t %s Enter\\\"\",\n```\n\n### 2. [Important] AC3 log entry not implemented (tmux.go:483-501)\nAC3 says \"a log entry is written to the dispatcher log\" but buildPaneDiedHook only sends a message to the surviving pane. No logEvent call, no file append. Either add logging or document that the [ORO-DISPATCH] prefix to the surviving pane IS the log mechanism.\n\n### 3. [Minor] Missing -d flag on paste-buffer (tmux.go:496)\npaste-buffer call omits `-d` (delete buffer after paste), unlike TmuxEscalator.Escalate() in escalator.go. Add `-d` for consistency.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] buildPaneDiedHook does not double-quote the escaped message (no outer single quotes around %s for escapeForShell output)\n- [ ] Pane-died hook either writes to dispatcher log or documents why the escalation message IS the log entry\n- [ ] paste-buffer uses -d flag consistent with TmuxEscalator.Escalate() pattern\n- [ ] Existing unit tests updated and passing\n- [ ] go test -race ./cmd/oro/... passes","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"bug","owner":"t@t.com","created_at":"2026-02-13T22:33:34.065854-05:00","created_by":"manager","updated_at":"2026-02-13T23:22:25.917302-05:00","closed_at":"2026-02-13T23:22:25.917302-05:00","close_reason":"Tests pass, gate clean.

The dispatcher sees new beads (via fsnotify → tryAssign → bd ready) but can't assign them because \\`targetWorkers\\` is 0 or insufficient. Workers are only spawned when the manager explicitly runs \\`oro directive scale N\\`.\n\n### Root cause chain:\n1. Architect runs \\`bd create\\` → bead exists in \\`bd ready\\`\n2. Dispatcher's \\`assignLoop\\` detects it via fsnotify → calls \\`tryAssign()\\`\n3. \\`tryAssign()\\` calls \\`filterAssignable()\\` → finds beads\n4. BUT \\`tryAssign()\\` only assigns to connected workers (dispatcher.go:1393-1410)\n5. Worker count is controlled by \\`targetWorkers\\` (set via \\`oro directive scale N\\`)\n6. Manager beacon only scales at startup (manager.go:27-37), no continuous monitoring\n7. **No notification** from architect → manager that new work exists\n\n## Design\n\nTwo-part fix:\n\n### Part 1: Dispatcher auto-scale (primary fix)\n\nAfter \\`tryAssign()\\` finds assignable beads but has no idle workers, auto-scale up to a configured max:\n\n\\`\\`\\`go\n// In tryAssign(), after filterAssignable returns beads:\nif len(beads) \u003e 0 {\n    d.mu.Lock()\n    idleCount := countIdleWorkers(d.workers)\n    maxWorkers := d.cfg.MaxWorkers // New config field, default 3\n    currentTarget := d.targetWorkers\n    d.mu.Unlock()\n\n    if idleCount == 0 \u0026\u0026 currentTarget \u003c maxWorkers {\n        // Auto-scale: set target to min(len(beads), maxWorkers)\n        newTarget := min(len(beads), maxWorkers)\n        if newTarget \u003e currentTarget {\n            d.mu.Lock()\n            d.targetWorkers = newTarget\n            d.mu.Unlock()\n            d.reconcileScale()\n            _ = d.logEvent(ctx, \"auto_scale\", \"dispatcher\", \"\", \"\",\n                fmt.Sprintf(\"scaled to %d workers (queue depth: %d)\", newTarget, len(beads)))\n        }\n    }\n}\n\\`\\`\\`\n\nAdd \\`MaxWorkers int\\` to \\`Config\\` (dispatcher.go:114). Default: 3. Set via \\`oro start --workers N\\` (already exists, maps to \\`--workers\\` flag in cmd_start.go).\n\n### Part 2: Architect → Manager notification (awareness)\n\nIn \\`architect_router.py\\`, when a \\`bd create\\` command is detected (currently passed through since it starts with \\`bd \\`), ALSO send a notification to the manager pane via tmux:\n\n\\`\\`\\`python\n# In route_command(), after identifying \"bd create\" commands:\nif trimmed.startswith(\"bd create\"):\n    # Don't block — let it execute locally\n    # But also notify manager\n    notify_manager(f\"[NEW WORK] Architect created a bead.

Worktree cleanup then destroys the evidence (branch, commits). The bead shows \"closed\" with a commit hash that exists nowhere.\n\nAudit of 2026-02-16 found **9 beads** falsely closed — code never reached main:\n- oro-w451: fix on branch agent/oro-w451, never cherry-picked\n- oro-vi0h: zero code exists anywhere (no branch, no commit)\n- oro-ldbd, oro-z5oc.2, oro-tapy, oro-ycjj.4: claimed commits exist nowhere\n- oro-p3wd, oro-9fme, oro-wm6x: no matching code patterns on main\n\n## Root Cause Analysis\n\nThe merge flow is: worker completes → QG passes → mergeAndComplete() → cherry-pick to main → bd close → worktree cleanup.\n\nFailure modes (all observed):\n1. **Cherry-pick fails silently** — merge conflict or rebase guard, error logged but bead still closed\n2. **Worker closes bead before merge** — bd close runs in worktree, merge happens after (or never)\n3. **Worktree cleanup destroys branch** — even if cherry-pick failed, the branch is deleted, losing the commits forever\n4. **No verification gate** — nothing checks that the commit actually exists on main before closing the bead\n\n## Fix Design\n\n### Guard 1: Verify commit on main before closing bead\nIn mergeAndComplete(), after cherry-pick, verify the commit exists on main with `git branch --contains \u003chash\u003e`. Only call bd close if verified. If cherry-pick failed, leave bead open with a note.\n\n### Guard 2: Never delete worktree branch if merge failed\nIn worktree cleanup, check merge status before deleting the branch. If the branch has commits not on main, preserve it and log a warning.\n\n### Guard 3: Post-close verification\nAdd a periodic sweep (or hook) that cross-references closed beads with main commits.

These profiles are the single source of truth consumed by both quality_gate.sh and the worker prompt.\n\n## Design: Language Profiles (Approach A)\n\n### Core abstraction\n\n```go\ntype Tool struct {\n    Name       string   // e.g. \"biome\", \"ruff\", \"gofumpt\"\n    Cmd        string   // e.g. \"biome check .\"\n    DetectCmd  string   // e.g. \"biome --version\" — used to check if installed\n    InstallHint string  // e.g. \"npm install -D @biomejs/biome\"\n}\n\ntype LangProfile struct {\n    Language    string                        // \"go\", \"python\", \"typescript\", \"javascript\"\n    Detect      func(projectRoot string) bool // go.mod? package.json with ts? pyproject.toml?\n    Formatters  []Tool\n    Linters     []Tool\n    TestCmd     string                        // \"go test -race ./...\", \"vitest run\", \"pytest\"\n    TypeCheck   *Tool                         // tsc --noEmit, pyright, nil for Go\n    Security    *Tool                         // govulncheck, npm audit, pip-audit\n    CodingRules []string                      // injected into worker prompt section 4\n    CoverageCmd string                        // coverage extraction command\n    CoverageMin int                           // minimum coverage threshold (e.g. 90)\n}\n```\n\n### Supported languages and opinionated defaults\n\n**Go:**\n- Detect: go.mod exists\n- Formatters: gofumpt, goimports\n- Linters: golangci-lint, go-arch-lint\n- Test: go test -race -shuffle=on ./...\n- TypeCheck: go vet (built-in)\n- Security: govulncheck\n- CodingRules: functional first, early returns, table-driven tests\n\n**Python:**\n- Detect: pyproject.toml OR setup.py OR requirements.txt\n- Formatters: ruff format (default), detect black if configured\n- Linters: ruff check (default), detect pylint/flake8 if configured\n- Test: pytest via uv (default), detect unittest if no pytest\n- TypeCheck: pyright (default), detect mypy if configured\n- Security: pip-audit\n- CodingRules: PEP 8, f-strings, pytest fixtures \u003e classes, type hints\n\n**TypeScript:**\n- Detect: tsconfig.json exists\n- Formatters: biome fmt (default), detect prettier if configured\n- Linters: biome check (default), detect eslint if configured\n- Test: vitest (default), detect jest if configured\n- TypeCheck: tsc --noEmit\n- Security: npm audit\n- CodingRules: strict mode, no any, prefer const, functional patterns\n\n**JavaScript:**\n- Detect: package.json without tsconfig.json\n- Formatters: biome fmt (default), detect prettier if configured\n- Linters: biome check (default), detect eslint if configured\n- Test: vitest (default), detect jest if configured\n- TypeCheck: nil\n- Security: npm audit\n- CodingRules: strict mode, prefer const, functional patterns\n\n### Config generation (.oro/config.yaml)\n\n`oro init` or first `oro start` scans the project:\n1. Run each LangProfile.Detect against project root\n2. For each detected language, check which default tools are installed\n3. Scan project config files for existing tool preferences:\n   - package.json scripts/devDependencies for eslint/prettier/jest/vitest\n   - pyproject.toml [tool.*] sections for ruff/black/mypy/pytest\n   - .golangci.yml for golangci-lint config\n4. Generate .oro/config.yaml with resolved tool choices\n\n```yaml\n# .oro/config.yaml — generated by oro init, editable by user\nlanguages:\n  go:\n    formatters: [gofumpt, goimports]\n    linters: [golangci-lint]\n    test: \"go test -race -shuffle=on\"\n    typecheck: \"go vet\"\n    security: govulncheck\n    coverage_min: 90\n  typescript:\n    formatters: [biome fmt]\n    linters: [biome check]\n    test: \"vitest run\"\n    typecheck: \"tsc --noEmit\"\n    security: \"npm audit\"\n    coverage_min: 80\n```\n\n### quality_gate.sh becomes config-driven\n\nInstead of hardcoded language blocks, quality_gate.sh reads .oro/config.yaml:\n- For each language in config, run formatters → linters → typecheck → tests → security\n- Same tiered structure (format → lint → type → test → security → build)\n- Same check() / header() functions\n- But tool names and commands come from config, not hardcoded bash\n\n### Worker prompt becomes config-driven\n\nAssemblePrompt reads .oro/config.yaml to populate:\n- Section 4 (Coding Rules): language-specific rules from LangProfile.CodingRules\n- Section 5 (TDD): language-appropriate test command\n- Section 6 (Quality Gate): still ./quality_gate.sh, but worker knows what tools to expect\n\n### Adaptation logic\n\nDetection priority (for each tool category):\n1. .oro/config.yaml if it exists (user has overridden) — highest priority\n2. Project config files (package.json, pyproject.toml, etc.) — detected tools\n3. LangProfile defaults — fallback\n\nExample: if package.json has eslint in devDependencies, .oro/config.yaml gets eslint instead of biome. User can then manually change to biome if they prefer.\n\n### What this enables\n\n- `oro init` on a Next.js project → detects TypeScript, generates config with biome/vitest/tsc, quality gate covers TS\n- `oro init` on a Django project → detects Python, generates config with ruff/pytest/pyright, quality gate covers Python\n- `oro init` on a monorepo with Go + Python → detects both, generates config for both, quality gate runs both tiers\n- Workers get language-appropriate prompts regardless of what project they're working in\n- Adding a new language = adding a LangProfile struct, no changes to quality gate or prompt assembly","acceptance_criteria":"oro init on a fresh TypeScript project generates .oro/config.yaml with TS tools and quality_gate.sh passes with TS checks. Worker prompt includes TS coding rules. Same for Python and Go projects.","status":"closed","priority":4,"issue_type":"epic","owner":"mraakashshah@users.noreply.github.com","created_at":"2026-02-10T17:17:43.849306-05:00","created_by":"Aakash Shah","updated_at":"2026-02-14T01:48:46.119094-05:00","closed_at":"2026-02-14T01:48:46.119094-05:00","close_reason":"All 7 children completed"}

This makes oro unusable in repos that already have their own Claude Code configuration, and pollutes project history with oro-specific files.\n\n**What oro currently writes into the target repo (all tracked in git):**\n- `.beads/` — issues.jsonl, interactions.jsonl, knowledge.jsonl, formulas, config, metadata\n- `.claude/hooks/` — 15+ hooks (worktree guards, skill enforcement, context injection, etc.)\n- `.claude/skills/` — 30+ skills (TDD, debugging, brainstorming, agent-browser, etc.)\n- `.claude/settings.json` — hook configuration, tool permissions\n- `.claude/commands/` — restart-oro, toggle-priming\n- `.claude/hooks/beacons/` — architect.md, manager.md (role prompts)\n- `docs/handoffs/` — session handoff YAML files\n- `docs/decisions-and-discoveries.md` — architectural log\n- `.claude/review-patterns.md` — code review patterns\n\n**Why this is a P0:**\n- Oro cannot be used in any project that has its own `.claude/` setup without stomping on it\n- Every project oro touches gets 50+ committed files that have nothing to do with the project\n- Makes oro non-portable — it's welded to the oro repo itself right now\n\n## Prior Art: Gas Town\n\nGas Town (steveyegge/gastown) solves this cleanly:\n1. **`--settings` flag** — Claude Code supports `claude --settings \u003cpath\u003e` which merges a settings file additively with the project's own `.claude/settings.json`\n2. **Parent directory trick** — places `.claude/settings.json` in a parent directory above the cloned repo; Claude Code walks up the tree and finds it\n3. **Global config** — hooks/overrides live in `~/.gt/`, never in the target repo\n4. **Role-based layering** — base config + role overrides + rig-specific overrides, merged at launch\n\n## Proposed Architecture\n\n```\n~/.oro/                              # global oro home (XDG_DATA_HOME compliant)\n  config.yaml                        # global oro settings\n  skills/                            # skill library (shared across all projects)\n    agent-browser/SKILL.md\n    brainstorming/SKILL.md\n    ...30+ skills\n  hooks/                             # hook scripts (shared)\n    enforce-skills.sh\n    worktree_guard.py\n    ...15+ hooks\n  hooks-base.json                    # base .claude/settings.json template\n  hooks-overrides/                   # per-role settings overrides\n    architect.json\n    manager.json\n    worker.json\n  beacons/                           # role prompt templates\n    architect.md\n    manager.md\n  templates/                         # handoff/decision templates\n\n~/.oro/projects/\u003cproject-name\u003e/      # per-project persistent state\n  beads/                             # issue tracker (currently .beads/)\n    issues.jsonl\n    interactions.jsonl\n    memory/knowledge.jsonl\n    formulas/\n  handoffs/                          # session handoff YAMLs\n  decisions.md                       # architectural log\n  generated/                         # generated settings files for claude --settings\n    architect-settings.json\n    manager-settings.json\n    worker-settings.json\n\n\u003ctarget-project\u003e/                    # THE ACTUAL PROJECT — UNTOUCHED\n  .claude/                           # project's own Claude Code config (if any)\n  .gitignore                         # no oro entries needed\n  src/\n  ...\n```\n\n## Key Design Decisions to Make\n\n1. **Settings injection**: Use `claude --settings` flag or parent-directory `.claude/settings.json`? Gas Town uses both — parent dir for hierarchy, --settings for explicit overrides.\n\n2. **Skill discovery**: Claude Code discovers skills from `.claude/skills/`. If we move skills to `~/.oro/skills/`, how do agents find them? Options:\n   - Symlink `~/.oro/skills/` into a parent `.claude/skills/`\n   - Use `--settings` to inject skill paths (if supported)\n   - Generate a CLAUDE.md that references skill content inline\n\n3. **Beads CLI**: `bd` currently assumes `.beads/` is in CWD. Needs `--project` flag or env var (`ORO_PROJECT`) to find `~/.oro/projects/\u003cname\u003e/beads/`.\n\n4. **Hooks**: Currently live in `.claude/hooks/`. With externalization:\n   - Hook scripts go to `~/.oro/hooks/`\n   - `hooks-base.json` defines the hook config pointing to those scripts\n   - `oro init \u003cproject\u003e` generates role-specific settings.json files\n   - `oro start` passes `--settings` to each agent\n\n5. **CLAUDE.md**: Currently checked into the project. Options:\n   - Minimal stub in project: `See .oro/CLAUDE.md for oro instructions`\n   - Inject via hook at SessionStart\n   - Use parent directory CLAUDE.md (Claude Code walks up)\n\n6. **Migration**: How to migrate the oro repo itself from embedded to externalized config.\n\n7. **`oro init`**: New command that:\n   - Creates `~/.oro/projects/\u003cname\u003e/` structure\n   - Links/generates settings files\n   - Optionally adds `.oro/` to project's `.gitignore`\n   - Does NOT modify `.claude/` in the target project\n\n8. **`oro eject`**: Reverse of init — remove all oro traces from a project.\n\n## What NOT to Externalize\n\nSome things might legitimately belong in the target project:\n- Project-specific hooks (quality gate config?)\n- Project-specific CLAUDE.md instructions\n- `.oro/config.yaml` — local project oro config (gitignored)\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] Brainstorm session produces a design spec\n- [ ] Design spec covers all 8 decision points above\n- [ ] Design spec includes migration plan for existing oro repo\n- [ ] Design spec addresses how workers in worktrees access externalized config\n- [ ] Design spec addresses how `bd` CLI finds beads when not in CWD","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"mraakashshah@users.noreply.github.com","created_at":"2026-02-15T00:01:17.692663-05:00","created_by":"Aakash Shah","updated_at":"2026-02-15T12:11:04.688712-05:00","closed_at":"2026-02-15T12:11:04.688712-05:00","close_reason":"Design spec complete at docs/plans/2026-02-15-config-externalization-design.md.

{"id":"oro-jzsi","title":"Use live queue depth in status response instead of stale cache","description":"## Problem\n`oro status` shows a stale queue depth. The dispatcher uses `d.cachedQueueDepth` (dispatcher.go:1930) in `buildStatusJSON()`, which is only updated when `tryAssign()` runs on the polling interval (dispatcher.go:1562-1564). Between poll ticks, the status response shows outdated data.\n\n## Root Cause\n`buildStatusJSON()` reads `d.cachedQueueDepth` under lock, but this value was set the last time `tryAssign()` ran. The status directive is user-triggered (via `oro status`), so it can happen at any time between assign loop ticks.\n\n## Fix\nIn `buildStatusJSON()`, call `d.beads.Ready(ctx)` to get a live bead count instead of using `d.cachedQueueDepth`. Since status is user-triggered and infrequent, the extra bead source call is acceptable latency.\n\nNote: `buildStatusJSON()` currently takes no context parameter — its signature is `func (d *Dispatcher) buildStatusJSON() string`. It will need `ctx context.Context` added (and the call site at dispatcher.go:1830 updated to pass `ctx`).\n\n## Files\n- pkg/dispatcher/dispatcher.go:1911 — `buildStatusJSON()`: add ctx param, call `d.beads.Ready(ctx)`\n- pkg/dispatcher/dispatcher.go:1830 — call site: pass ctx\n- pkg/dispatcher/dispatcher.go:1930 — replace `d.cachedQueueDepth` with live count\n- pkg/dispatcher/dispatcher_test.go — update tests for new signature\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Test: `buildStatusJSON` returns current bead count from bead source, not stale cached value\n- [ ] Test: status response `queue_depth` matches actual `beads.Ready()` count at time of request\n- [ ] Existing status tests still pass","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"bug","owner":"mraakashshah@users.noreply.github.com","created_at":"2026-02-16T12:46:15.263983-05:00","created_by":"architect","updated_at":"2026-02-17T00:18:37.700224-05:00","closed_at":"2026-02-17T00:18:37.700224-05:00","close_reason":"Merged to main as ed4eb75.

{"id":"oro-rg4u","title":"Add one-shot claude -p manager as first responder for dispatcher escalations","description":"Add a one-shot manager tier between the dispatcher and the persistent interactive manager. When the dispatcher detects an escalation (STUCK_WORKER, MERGE_CONFLICT, PRIORITY_CONTENTION, MISSING_AC), it spawns a short-lived 'claude -p' process with a manager playbook + escalation context + recent history from the persistent escalation queue. The one-shot handles routine cases autonomously; unresolved escalations bubble up to the persistent manager.\n\n## Open Design Question\nHow does the dispatcher know if the one-shot succeeded?\n- Option A: Ack-based — one-shot must ack the escalation via CLI before exiting. Unacked = failed.\n- Option B: State verification — dispatcher re-checks the triggering condition after process exit. Problem persists = failed.\n- Option C: Both — ack proves agent tried, state check proves it worked.\nWorker should evaluate and pick.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Dispatcher spawns claude -p with manager playbook on escalation\n- [ ] One-shot receives escalation type, bead context, and recent escalation history as prompt\n- [ ] One-shot has access to oro directive and bd CLI commands\n- [ ] Dispatcher detects one-shot failure and escalates to persistent manager\n- [ ] One-shot timeout prevents runaway processes (e.g., 5 min max)\n- [ ] Escalations that the one-shot resolves are marked acked in the persistent queue","notes":"Decomposed into oro-pi5l → oro-jydf → oro-sh9f → oro-vi0h.

{"id":"oro-rgx","title":"Rework role identity: env vars + SessionStart hook instead of send-keys beacon","description":"Adopt the Gastown pattern for role identity. Currently oro puts all role differentiation weight on a fragile tmux send-keys beacon injection that silently fails for large payloads.\n\nGastown pattern to adopt:\n1. Unique tmux session names per role (e.g. oro-architect, oro-manager instead of oro:0.0/oro:0.1)\n2. Environment variables set at launch: ORO_ROLE=architect/manager, BD_ACTOR=architect/manager, GIT_AUTHOR_NAME=architect/manager\n3. SessionStart hook reads ORO_ROLE and injects role-specific context (architect beacon vs manager beacon) — no need for send-keys of huge strings\n4. Separate working directories per role (or at minimum separate session storage)\n5. Beacon becomes a small nudge/kick, not the entire role prompt\n\nThis replaces the current approach in cmd/oro/tmux.go where Create() sends the full ArchitectBeacon()/ManagerBeacon() (~100-150 lines each) via tmux send-keys.\n\nFiles to change:\n- cmd/oro/tmux.go — session creation, pane naming, env var injection\n- .claude/hooks/ — add ORO_ROLE-aware SessionStart hook that injects role context\n- cmd/oro/architect.go — beacon becomes hook-injectable context, not send-keys payload\n- cmd/oro/manager.go — same\n- cmd/oro/cmd_start.go — wire new session names\n\nReference: Gastown internal/config/env.go (AgentEnv), internal/session/names.go, SessionStart hook pattern.","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"mraakashshah@users.noreply.github.com","created_at":"2026-02-10T18:42:38.106578-05:00","created_by":"Aakash Shah","updated_at":"2026-02-10T21:11:24.152732-05:00","closed_at":"2026-02-10T21:11:24.152732-05:00","close_reason":"Role identity reworked with env vars + hooks.

The dispatcher has no way to detect this and never retries.\n\nThe dispatcher already has a persistent store (state.db with an events table) and already uses file-based signals for the pane monitor (handoff_requested/handoff_complete). Escalations should be similarly durable.\n\nDesign options (worker should evaluate and pick):\n\nOption A — Persistent queue in SQLite:\n- Write escalations to a new escalations table (id, type, bead_id, message, created_at, acked_at)\n- Dispatcher retries unacked escalations every N minutes via tmux\n- Manager runs oro directive ack-escalation \u003cid\u003e after processing\n\nOption B — File-based queue (simpler):\n- Write escalations to ~/.oro/panes/manager/escalations/ as individual files\n- Manager's SessionStart hook reads and displays pending escalations\n- Manager deletes file after processing\n\nOption C — Hybrid:\n- Store in SQLite for durability and queryability\n- Use file signal to wake the manager (like handoff_requested pattern)\n- Manager reads pending escalations via oro directive pending-escalations\n\nKey constraint: tmux paste-buffer is unreliable as a delivery mechanism.

{"id":"oro-t19z","title":"Simplify restart-oro skill: replace manual Phase 2 cleanup with oro cleanup","description":"## Problem\n\nThe restart-oro skill (.claude/commands/restart-oro.md) has redundant cleanup steps. Phase 1 already calls \\`./oro cleanup\\` which handles tmux kill, dispatcher kill, worker kill, worktree prune, agent branch deletion, and bead reset. Phase 2 then manually repeats most of these same operations.\n\n## Current State\n\n**Phase 1** (Kill Everything):\n- \\`tmux kill-session -t oro\\` — redundant, oro cleanup does this\n- \\`./oro cleanup\\` — the comprehensive cleanup command\n- \\`pkill -f \"oro start/worker\"\\` — belt-and-suspenders\n\n**Phase 2** (Clean Stale State):\n- \\`git worktree prune\\` — already done by oro cleanup (cleanupWorktrees)\n- \\`git branch -D agent/*\\` — already done by oro cleanup (cleanupAgentBranches)\n- \\`rm -rf .worktrees/\\` — NOT done by oro cleanup (it only prunes references)\n- Verification commands — still useful\n\n**oro cleanup implementation** (cmd/oro/cmd_cleanup.go):\n1. cleanupTmux — kills tmux session\n2. cleanupDispatcher — signals dispatcher via SIGINT\n3. cleanupWorkers — kills worker processes\n4. cleanupPIDFile — removes stale PID file\n5. cleanupSocketFile — removes stale socket file\n6. cleanupWorktrees — runs git worktree prune\n7. cleanupAgentBranches — deletes agent/* branches\n8. cleanupBeads — resets in_progress beads to open\n\n## Changes\n\n### 1. Add .worktrees/ directory removal to oro cleanup\n\nAdd a new step in runCleanup (cmd/oro/cmd_cleanup.go) between cleanupWorktrees and cleanupAgentBranches:\n\n```go\n// cleanupWorktreeDir force-removes the .worktrees/ directory.\nfunc cleanupWorktreeDir(cfg *cleanupConfig) bool {\n    dir := filepath.Join(\".\", \".worktrees\")\n    if _, err := os.Stat(dir); errors.Is(err, os.ErrNotExist) {\n        return false\n    }\n    fmt.Fprintf(cfg.w, \"removing .worktrees/ directory\\n\")\n    if err := os.RemoveAll(dir); err != nil {\n        fmt.Fprintf(cfg.w, \"warning: remove .worktrees/: %v\\n\", err)\n    }\n    return true\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Simplify restart-oro skill Phase 2\n\nReplace the manual git commands in Phase 2 with just verification:\n\n```markdown\n## Phase 2: Verify Clean State\n\n\\`\\`\\`bash\ngit worktree list\ngit branch | grep agent/ || echo \"No stale agent branches\"\nls .worktrees/ 2\u003e/dev/null || echo \"No worktree directory\"\n\\`\\`\\`\n\nAll cleanup is handled by \\`oro cleanup\\` in Phase 1. This phase only verifies.\n```\n\n## Files to Modify\n- cmd/oro/cmd_cleanup.go — Add cleanupWorktreeDir step\n- cmd/oro/cmd_cleanup_test.go — Test the new cleanup step\n- .claude/commands/restart-oro.md — Simplify Phase 2 to verification only\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Test: cmd/oro/cmd_cleanup_test.go:TestCleanupWorktreeDir | Cmd: go test -race ./cmd/oro/... -run TestCleanupWorktreeDir | Assert: .worktrees/ directory is removed when it exists; no error when it doesn't exist\n- [ ] restart-oro.md Phase 2 no longer contains manual git worktree prune or git branch -D commands\n- [ ] oro cleanup removes .worktrees/ directory when present\n\nRead: cmd/oro/cmd_cleanup.go:runCleanup,cleanupWorktrees, cmd/oro/cmd_cleanup_test.go, .claude/commands/restart-oro.md","status":"closed","priority":3,"issue_type":"task","owner":"t@t.com","created_at":"2026-02-14T01:43:19.948737-05:00","created_by":"architect","updated_at":"2026-02-14T23:26:33.529217-05:00","closed_at":"2026-02-14T23:26:33.529217-05:00","close_reason":"Tests pass, gate clean.

Workers have full automated lifecycle (heartbeat → threshold → handoff → respawn). This epic adds the same for panes.\n\nDesign: File-based context monitoring. PostToolUse hook writes context_pct to ~/.oro/panes/\u003crole\u003e/context_pct. Dispatcher polls, writes handoff_requested signal on threshold. PreToolUse hook injects system reminder forcing create-handoff. Agent writes handoff to ~/.oro/panes/\u003crole\u003e/handoff.yaml. Dispatcher detects completion, kills tmux pane, relaunches. SessionStart hook reads per-role handoff on startup.\n\nKey decisions:\n- File-based (not UDS) — agents are interactive Claude sessions, not Go processes with persistent connections\n- Per-role paths under ~/.oro/panes/ — separates automated recovery from human-readable docs/handoffs/\n- Event-based restart: handoff creation triggers kill+restart, not a timer\n- If human is interacting, they manage handoff themselves\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\nAll child beads closed.
