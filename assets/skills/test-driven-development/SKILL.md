# Test-Driven Development (TDD)

## Overview

Write the test first. Watch it fail. Write minimal code to pass.

**Core principle:** If you didn't watch the test fail, you don't know if it tests the right thing.

**Violating the letter of the rules is violating the spirit of the rules.**

## When to Use

**Always:**
- New features
- Bug fixes
- Refactoring
- Behavior changes

**Exceptions (ask the user):**
- Throwaway prototypes
- Generated code
- Configuration files

Thinking "skip TDD just this once"? Stop. That's rationalization.

## The Iron Law

```
NO PRODUCTION CODE WITHOUT A FAILING TEST FIRST
```

Write code before the test? Delete it. Start over.

**No exceptions:**
- Don't keep it as "reference"
- Don't "adapt" it while writing tests
- Don't look at it
- Delete means delete

Implement fresh from tests. Period.

## Red-Green-Refactor

### RED - Write Failing Test

Write one minimal test showing what should happen.

<Good>
```python
def test_retries_failed_operations_3_times():
    attempts = 0

    def operation():
        nonlocal attempts
        attempts += 1
        if attempts < 3:
            raise RuntimeError("fail")
        return "success"

    result = retry_operation(operation)

    assert result == "success"
    assert attempts == 3
```
Clear name, tests real behavior, one thing
</Good>

<Bad>
```python
def test_retry_works(mocker):
    mock = mocker.patch("module.operation",
        side_effect=[RuntimeError(), RuntimeError(), "success"])
    retry_operation(mock)
    assert mock.call_count == 3
```
Vague name, tests mock not code
</Bad>

**Requirements:**
- One behavior
- Clear name
- Real code (no mocks unless unavoidable)

### Verify RED - Watch It Fail

**MANDATORY. Never skip.**

```bash
# Go
go test ./path/to/...

# Python
uv run pytest path/to/test_file.py
```

Confirm:
- Test fails (not errors)
- Failure message is expected
- Fails because feature missing (not typos)

**Test passes?** You're testing existing behavior. Fix test.

**Test errors?** Fix error, re-run until it fails correctly.

### GREEN - Minimal Code

Write simplest code to pass the test.

<Good>
```go
func RetryOperation[T any](fn func() (T, error)) (T, error) {
    var zero T
    for i := 0; i < 3; i++ {
        result, err := fn()
        if err == nil {
            return result, nil
        }
        if i == 2 {
            return zero, err
        }
    }
    return zero, errors.New("unreachable")
}
```
Just enough to pass
</Good>

<Bad>
```go
func RetryOperation[T any](
    fn func() (T, error),
    opts ...RetryOption,  // YAGNI
) (T, error) {
    // configurable retries, backoff, callbacks...
}
```
Over-engineered
</Bad>

Don't add features, refactor other code, or "improve" beyond the test.

### Verify GREEN - Watch It Pass

**MANDATORY.**

```bash
go test ./path/to/...
uv run pytest path/to/test_file.py
```

Confirm:
- Test passes
- Other tests still pass
- Output pristine (no errors, warnings)

**Test fails?** Fix code, not test.

### REFACTOR - Clean Up

After green only:
- Remove duplication
- Improve names
- Extract helpers

Keep tests green. Don't add behavior.

## Common Rationalizations

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "Too simple to test" | Simple code breaks. Test takes 30 seconds. |
| "I'll test after" | Tests passing immediately prove nothing. |
| "Already manually tested" | Ad-hoc ≠ systematic. No record, can't re-run. |
| "Deleting X hours is wasteful" | Sunk cost fallacy. Keeping unverified code is debt. |
| "Keep as reference" | You'll adapt it. That's testing after. Delete means delete. |
| "Need to explore first" | Fine. Throw away exploration, start with TDD. |
| "TDD will slow me down" | TDD faster than debugging. Pragmatic = test-first. |

## Red Flags - STOP and Start Over

- Code before test
- Test after implementation
- Test passes immediately
- Can't explain why test failed
- "Just this once"
- "Keep as reference"
- "Already spent X hours"
- "This is different because..."

**All of these mean: Delete code. Start over with TDD.**

## When Stuck

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Don't know how to test | Write wished-for API. Write assertion first. Ask the user. |
| Test too complicated | Design too complicated. Simplify interface. |
| Must mock everything | Code too coupled. Use dependency injection. |
| Test setup huge | Extract helpers. Still complex? Simplify design. |

## Verification Checklist

Before marking work complete:

- [ ] Every new function/method has a test
- [ ] Watched each test fail before implementing
- [ ] Each test failed for expected reason
- [ ] Wrote minimal code to pass each test
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Output pristine (no errors, warnings)
- [ ] Tests use real code (mocks only if unavoidable)
- [ ] Edge cases and errors covered

Can't check all boxes? You skipped TDD. Start over.

## Final Rule

```
Production code → test exists and failed first
Otherwise → not TDD
```

No exceptions without the user's permission.
