## 2026-02-07: Add reflection step to finishing-work
**Tags:** #skills #workflow #feedback-loops
**Context:** Reviewed aleiby/claude-skills/tackle — its reflect phase logs friction after every PR as queryable data
**Decision:** Added Step 4 (Reflect) to finishing-work skill. Captures off-script moments, slowdowns, and improvement suggestions before cleanup.
**Implications:** Skills can self-improve over time if friction is consistently logged. "Clean run" should be rare — most work has learnable friction.
