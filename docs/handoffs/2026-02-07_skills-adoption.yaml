goal: Build comprehensive skill library for oro from 3 reference implementations (Superpowers, Continuous Claude v3, Compound Engineering)
now: Commit uncommitted changes (writing-skills update, planning.md), then move to actual project work — skills are done
test: ls .claude/skills/ | wc -l  # should be 28

done_this_session:
  - task: Created 23 base skills from reference implementations
    commit: d8a7757
    files: [.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md]

  - task: Added 4 more skills (tmux, session-logs, github, beads) + merged skill-creator insights into writing-skills
    commit: d4da4d5
    sources: [openclaw/tmux, openclaw/session-logs, openclaw/github, beads plugin]

  - task: Merged agent context isolation into dispatching-parallel-agents
    commit: f1a6a7d
    detail: File-based coordination, no TaskOutput, no polling — from CC-v3

  - task: Created git-commits skill with tier-based conventional commits
    commit: 8e59213
    source: https://skills.sh/vasilyu1983/ai-agents-public/git-commit-message

  - task: Added env file auto-copying to using-git-worktrees
    commit: c0ef156

  - task: Added "Skill vs Rule vs Hook" decision tree to writing-skills
    status: uncommitted
    file: .claude/skills/writing-skills/SKILL.md

  - task: Appended future reference notes to planning.md
    status: uncommitted
    file: yap/planning.md

skills_inventory:
  count: 28
  categories:
    discipline: [test-driven-development, systematic-debugging, verification-before-completion, observe-before-editing, destructive-command-safety, using-skills]
    workflow: [brainstorming, writing-plans, executing-plans, requesting-code-review, receiving-code-review, finishing-work]
    orchestration: [dispatching-parallel-agents, workflow-routing, premortem, completion-check, explore]
    tools: [beads, git-commits, tmux, github, session-logs]
    continuity: [create-handoff, resume-handoff, documenting-solutions, refactor, using-git-worktrees, writing-skills]

decisions:
  excluded_from_CC-v3: "90+ CC-v3 skills excluded — tool-specific wrappers (tldr, agentica, MCP), infrastructure plumbing, or architectural rules that belong as rules not skills"
  excluded_from_CE: "Ruby-specific (dhh-rails-style, andrew-kane-gem-writer), tool-specific (gemini-imagegen, agent-browser, rclone), agent-native-architecture (product design philosophy not process skill)"
  compound_learnings_deferred: "Requires learnings cache infrastructure we don't have yet. Decision tree extracted into writing-skills."
  compound_docs_simplified: "510-line Rails-specific version simplified into documenting-solutions (~200 words)"
  context_isolation_merged: "Not a standalone skill — merged into dispatching-parallel-agents as step 4"
  no_remote_configured: "git push not possible — no remote set up yet"

global_adaptations_applied:
  - "your human partner → the user"
  - "superpowers:skill-name → skill-name (flat namespace)"
  - "TypeScript/JS examples → Go + Python"
  - "npm test → go test ./... / uv run pytest"
  - "Removed tool-specific dependencies (tldr, agentica, MCP)"
  - "All descriptions follow CSO rule (conditions only, no workflow summaries)"

worked:
  - "Strategic adoption — reading source, assessing overlap with existing rules/skills, only pulling genuine gaps"
  - "Merging related concepts into existing skills instead of creating new ones"
  - "Parallel agent reads for batch evaluation"

failed:
  - "Background agent ae6232d crashed (classifyHandoffIfNeeded undefined) — but output was already read before failure, no data lost"

next:
  - Commit writing-skills update and planning.md changes
  - Set up git remote and push all local commits
  - Start actual project work — skill library is complete
  - Consider Context7 MCP explicit config (currently injected by wrw plugin)
