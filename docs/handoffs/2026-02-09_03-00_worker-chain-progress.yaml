goal: >
  Merge completed worker branches (is9.2, is9.3) to main and close is9 epic.

done:
  - "Merged is9.2 (oro directive CLI) — 4 new files, 359 insertions"
  - "Merged is9.3 (fsnotify watcher) — 4 files, 151 insertions"
  - "Closed is9 epic (all 3 sub-beads merged)"
  - "Cleaned up ptz branch (worker was stuck, no commits)"

decisions:
  - preflight_deletion_bug: >
      Both is9.2 and is9.3 sonnet workers independently deleted
      preflight files outside their bead scope. Rebase onto main
      auto-resolved this (main already had the files). Need worker
      prompt guardrail to prevent this pattern.
  - never_cd_into_worktree: >
      Shell CWD corrupted when worktree was removed while cd'd into it.
      NEVER cd into a worktree from the manager session.

next:
  - Spawn mgf worker (now unblocked by is9 closure)
  - Respawn ptz worker (stuck on both attempts, needs investigation)
  - Add worker prompt guardrail against deleting files outside bead scope
