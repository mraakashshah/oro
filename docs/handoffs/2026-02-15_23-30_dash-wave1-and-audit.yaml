goal: >
  Managed swarm through dashboard Wave 1 epic (oro-cjas, 8 beads) and pane lifecycle
  epic (oro-zays) to completion. Merged 20+ beads to main including worker tracking
  (oro-wj85, 4/5 done), CI fix (oro-intj), bd URL fix (oro-09ws). Deep-audited oro-dash
  code and filed 8 bug/improvement beads. Handled merge conflicts via cherry-pick,
  resolved real conflicts (cjas.4 insights + cjas.1 navigation), fixed review findings
  (cjas.3 search, cjas.7 cards, wj85.5 eventlog).

now: >
  Monitor remaining beads: oro-wj85.3 (workers table — stalled once, reassigned),
  oro-zjxg (hooks into repo), oro-tfcx (architect commit), oro-swcx (escalation queue).
  Close oro-wj85 epic when .3 lands. Workers should pick up the 8 new dash bugs filed.

test: make stage-assets && go test ./... && bd stats

      Critical: cursor not clamped on refresh (oro-e285), inverted dep graph (oro-wm6x).
      Important: Done column oldest-first (oro-2nvf), blocking I/O (oro-dzmt),
      styles every frame (oro-yiic). Minor: dead code (oro-ah12), fixed widths (oro-yoov),
      DaysSinceUpdate always 0 (oro-pj9s).

decisions:
  - manual_wj85_2_merge: >
      Worker's cjas.7 commit removed workerDataMsg and assignments map, reverting
      card enrichment from cjas.7. Aborted cherry-pick and manually applied only the
      WorkerStatus struct enrichment, preserving assignments flow.
  - review_false_positives_pattern: >
      cjas.8 and cjas.7 review rejections were false positives from stale branch diffs.
      cjas.3 and wj85.5 had legitimate findings that needed fixing. Pattern: check
      git show --stat on the actual commit before trusting review findings.

findings:
  - real_merge_conflict_resolution: >
      cjas.4 (insights) had a real conflict with cjas.1 (navigation) in model.go.
      Both modified Update() and View(). Resolution: keep handleKeyPress refactor from
      cjas.1, add i/esc keys into it for insights, use RenderWithCursor in board branch.
  - wj85_2_scope_creep: >
      Worker removed workerDataMsg/assignments/NewBoardModelWithWorkers, breaking card
      enrichment. Had to abort cherry-pick and manually apply only the struct changes.

worked:
  - Cherry-pick pattern for all worktree merges (consistent, reliable)
  - Checking git show --stat before trusting review findings
  - Manual application when cherry-pick would introduce regressions
  - Deep code audit with explore agent for thorough bug discovery

failed:
  - Blindly cherry-picking wj85.2 — it would have reverted card enrichment

next:
  - Monitor oro-wj85.3 (workers table — stalled, reassigned)
  - Close oro-wj85 epic when .3 lands
  - Monitor oro-zjxg (hooks into repo), oro-tfcx (architect commit), oro-swcx (escalation queue)
  - Workers should auto-pick up the 8 new dash bugs
  - Consider decomposing oro-ycjj (Wave 2) when Wave 1 bugs are fixed
  - Clean up stale worktrees
