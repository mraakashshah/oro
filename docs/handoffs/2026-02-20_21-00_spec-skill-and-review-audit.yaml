goal: >
  Created spec skill (brainstorm → adversarial-review → beads pipeline).
  Added structural-only scope guard to adversarial-spec-review.
  Started audit of potentially orphaned review skills.

now: >
  1. git push (2 commits ahead of origin — spec skill + adversarial-spec-review scope guard)
  2. Complete the orphaned skills audit (see open_question below)

test: go test ./... -race -count=1 && go build ./...

done_this_session:
  - task: Create spec skill — lightweight orchestration of brainstorm → adversarial-review → bead-craft
    files: [.claude/skills/spec/SKILL.md, .claude/skills/using-skills/SKILL.md]
    commit: 4344423
  - task: Add Scope section to adversarial-spec-review — structural findings only, self-check question
    files: [.claude/skills/adversarial-spec-review/SKILL.md]
    commit: 0d8ecee

decisions:
  spec_skill_as_lightweight_orchestrator: >
    User wanted a high-level skill that names the pipeline, not a CLI command.
    Skill just sequences brainstorming → adversarial-spec-review → bead-craft.
    No new logic — pure coordination.
  adversarial_review_scope_guard: >
    Added self-check question: "If this gap existed and all beads passed, would
    the feature be visibly broken or untestable?" If no → not a finding.
    Explicit in-scope/out-of-scope lists. Minor negative_space gaps must not
    affect verdict.

open_question:
  orphaned_skills_audit: >
    User asked: do we actually use these skills?
    - requesting-code-review
    - receiving-code-review
    - finishing-work
    - review-implementation
    - review-docs
    Search cut off at context limit. Partial findings:
    - workflow-routing/SKILL.md references them 5 times
    - executing-plans/SKILL.md references them 1 time
    - work-bead/SKILL.md: 0 references
    - executing-beads/SKILL.md: 0 references
    - No hooks or CLAUDE.md reference them
    Next: read workflow-routing and executing-plans to see if references are
    substantive (actively invoked) or just listed. Then read the 5 skills
    themselves to assess whether they overlap with existing spec/bead pipeline.
    Decision: keep, merge into spec skill, or delete.

next:
  - git push
  - Read workflow-routing/SKILL.md and executing-plans/SKILL.md to assess how
    the 5 skills are referenced
  - Read each of the 5 skills and decide: keep / merge / delete
  - Resume spec-suggest brainstorm (user chose option A — bd suggest "title"
    outputs drafted acceptance criteria — but session ended before full design)
