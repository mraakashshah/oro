goal: Refine skill library — add reflection loop, review skills, and decisions log. Evaluate external skills for adoption.
now: Skills are done. Next session should focus on beads work.

done_this_session:
  - task: Added docs/handoffs/ to gitignore
    commit: 6f10c56
    detail: Handoffs are internal session coordination, not project history

  - task: Committed project config files
    commit: d7081d2
    files: [.gitattributes, CLAUDE.MD, README.md, bcrCLAUDE.md]

  - task: Added reflection step to finishing-work
    commit: 3699e3c
    source: aleiby/claude-skills/tackle
    detail: Step 4 (Reflect) captures friction, off-script moments, improvement suggestions before cleanup

  - task: Added correction-awareness to reflect step
    commit: 9a273ff
    source: AI-Unleashed/Claude-Skills/autoskill (adapted, not adopted)
    detail: "Were you corrected? Propose a skill/rule edit. Self-directed, not user-correction harvesting."

  - task: Created review-docs and review-implementation skills
    commit: d0e45cd
    source: Xexr/marketplace/review-documentation (simplified)
    detail: Structured review categories, severity-weighted output, read-only review before fixes

  - task: Created docs/decisions-and-discoveries.md
    commit: 3699e3c
    detail: Ongoing log for architectural decisions. 3 entries so far.

skills_inventory:
  count: 30
  new: [review-docs, review-implementation]
  modified: [finishing-work]

decisions_made:
  - "Handoffs are internal — gitignored, not committed"
  - "Self-directed reflection over user-correction harvesting (autoskill rejected)"
  - "Doc review and implementation review are separate skills with different triggers"
  - "Review categories and severity-weighted output from Xexr, multi-LLM orchestration skipped"

what_comes_next:
  not_needed_yet:
    agents: "No recurring sub-agent pattern to extract yet — wait for real usage"
    workflows: "Skills already encode workflows (executing-plans, workflow-routing, dispatching-parallel-agents)"
  next_layer: "Hooks — automating lint-before-commit, auto-doc-review after code changes. That gives review skills teeth."
  actual_next: "Beads work. Skills will sharpen through use + the reflect step."
