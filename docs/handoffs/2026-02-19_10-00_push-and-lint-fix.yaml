goal: >
  Pushed 9 local commits to origin (main was ahead by 8), fixed gocritic lint
  failure blocking push, rebuilt oro binary on main.

now: >
  Main is clean and pushed. 10 ready beads available. Uncommitted changes in
  cmd_init.go (context7 permissions), cmd_init_test.go, and docs/ need review
  before committing — these are from a prior session's in-progress work.

test: go test ./cmd/oro/ && golangci-lint run ./cmd/oro/

done_this_session:
  - task: "Reviewed yesterday's throughput"
    details: >
      26 beads closed on Feb 18 across dashboard (nqi.*), codesearch (noc.*),
      reranker (cwz.*), E2E tests (8v2u.*), lang profiles (js7.*), and
      settings-only beads. 34 commits landed on main.

  - task: "Rebuilt oro binary on main"
    details: >
      Switched from agent/oro-qlvv.2 to main. Required make stage-assets
      before go build due to embed.go _assets dependency.
    files: [bin/oro]

  - task: "Fixed gocritic lint failure"
    details: >
      cmd/oro/cmd_status.go:203 had if-else chain that gocritic wanted as
      switch statement. Converted and committed.
    files: [cmd/oro/cmd_status.go]

  - task: "Pushed 9 commits to origin"
    details: >
      All 19 quality gate checks passed. Commits include langprofile tests,
      skills coverage test, worker unit tests, CLI smoke tests, codesearch
      reranker, audit script, docs rename, and the gocritic fix.

decisions:
  - stage_assets_required: >
      make stage-assets must be run before go build or golangci-lint when
      _assets/ dir is missing. Pre-commit hook also fails without it.

findings:
  - uncommitted_changes: >
      cmd_init.go has context7 MCP permissions additions, cmd_init_test.go
      has corresponding test updates, docs/decisions&discoveries.md has new
      entries. These appear to be from a prior oro work session (oro-r8ov or
      similar). Need review before committing to main.

  - stale_branch: >
      agent/oro-qlvv.2 branch still exists locally but has no worktree.
      Can be cleaned up with: git branch -D agent/oro-qlvv.2

next:
  - Review and commit uncommitted changes in cmd_init.go, cmd_init_test.go, docs/
  - Launch oro work for ready beads (oro-8g75, oro-u6hm, oro-qlvv.1, oro-b7l4)
  - Clean up stale agent/oro-qlvv.2 branch
